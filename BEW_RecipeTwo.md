## Stripe Payment Gateway
The stripe payment gateway as implemented requires a user to be logged in.

It does indeed add a subscription expiration date in the user model for one month in advance though I don't have any features blocked if the user is not subscribed. 

Currently you can navigate to it when logged in by clicking on the link in the footer.

Persuasive latin text implores you to open your wallet even though you may not consciously know why.

Please put your credit card in the thing and subscribe today.

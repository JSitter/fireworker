## SMS Messaging

This site has integrated SMS Messaging (Provided you have the proper authentication codes for Twilio).

## Where to find it

In order to demonstrate the sms features of this app, you need to have a user account.

When logged in you'll need to upload an image (a png or jpg will work though other formats may provide errors).

When logged, click "Upload New Document" to select and upload the image.

After uploading the image/s you should see them appear on your dashboard.

Clicking on one will make it turn green.

The green ones will be available for the new link.

When you have the items that you want to send selected, click on the "get single use link" button.

You should see a box pop up with the new single use link.

Underneath the link there is a second input box the says "recipients phone number."

Add the phone number that you want to send the link to in this box.

This input field does not respond with an error if the wrong number is input.

The phone number should be formatted as only digits. 

Thus the phone number `(818) 555-1234` should be input as 

`8185551234`

Enjoy texting until Twilio blocks my account for spam!

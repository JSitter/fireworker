## User Password Reset
If you have users, you'll need a way to reset a user's password or risk them losing access to their account.

This project implements a common pattern for resetting user's passwords using a token sent through email.

In order to run this project locally the required environment variables listed in the project's README.md file must be set.

This project is also available hosted on heroku at:
http://fireworker.herokuapp.com

In order to view the password reset, one must make a new user profile.

Upon logging out you can click the 'Forgot My Password' link on the main page.

You'll be prompted and sent a password reset link.
